# JSON C parser
There is likely better alternatives but this is a library for parsing JSON files into C data structures.

I personally have had issues doing this with other libraries on apple silicon so this aims to fill that gap using nothing system specific.

Should result in less features but a more lightweight and more portable library for using JSON with C.
